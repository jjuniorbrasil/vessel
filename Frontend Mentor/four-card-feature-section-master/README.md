## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Mainly, remembered how to use CSS grid. There's a lot of cool stuff you can use if you are able to manage the grid structure which you won't see here, but I pretend to implement later. I think I'm more confident about building a page from pre-made designs.

### Useful resources

- [This CSS Grid tutorial will always save your day](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - This helped me for XYZ reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
